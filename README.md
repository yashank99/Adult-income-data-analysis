Welcome to my Adult income Data Analytics project!

In this project, I aim to analyze the adult income dataset to gain insights into the factors that contribute to high income levels. The dataset contains information on various demographic and socioeconomic factors, such as age, education, occupation, work hours, and more, for individuals in the United States.

My goals for this project is to identify the key factors that influence income levels and create meaningful visualizations to communicate findings. I will be utilizing various analytical techniques such as data cleaning and exploratory data analysis.

I hope that my work in this project will provide valuable insights into the factors that contribute to high income levels and help us understand the dynamics of the labor market in the United States. I also hope that our findings can be used to inform policy decisions aimed at promoting economic growth and reducing income inequality.
